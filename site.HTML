<h1> Welcome to my webpage! This all about my horse, Cocoa. </h1>


<h2> <IMG SRC="pic 1.jpg"> </h2>

I am a 7 year old gelding with training in many different things including, dressage, show jumping and hunter jumping (lower outside jumps)
I was 3 years old when I got rescued by my owner's cousin Kristy. Emily was training another horse at the time but then started training me
Finally her cousin said that she could keep me and I wouldn't be sold to anyone else. That was the best day of my life. 
That was almost 5 years ago now. She is still my owner and we do everything together. She is my favorite person in the world and I will only let Kristy and her ride me. 
Emily show jumped me for a couple years but we have stopped competing for now because she is gone at college. Lets go onto the second page
