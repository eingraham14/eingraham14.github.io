Horses react in many different ways to different things. Some of them decide whether or not they trust them and that's what you
need. Here's a video that shows riding a horse is not easy, especially one you don't know. Some of those horses didn't know any better. They didn't know what to do so they reacted in what they think would get the best attention. 
I was like that. I am proud to say I am not anymore and I am a very well trained animal now and would never hurt anyone. 
I show for fun now. I don't have a random rider and am expected to perform with someone I don't know at all.
