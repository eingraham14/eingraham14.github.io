Having one of these horses is absolutely amazing. They may be bred as one thing but you can retrain them to be so many different things. 
If you ever want one or think about wanting one look online at different websites and see which ones are the best.
I've checked a few out that I like a lot so I'll link them so you guys can look at them. Here ya go!
